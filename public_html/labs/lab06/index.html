        <p>	There were no current problems on my home page (yay!), but there were some interesting potential problems. I included a logo that links back to the home page, and I put an alt tag on it. I might not need an alt tag for it because it’s decorative. I also didn’t realize that using a list for the navigation was helpful for accessibility (I only used divs and anchor tags), so I would go back and make my navigation into a list.</p>
        <p>For my “about me” site, I had problems with using the "i" tag instead of the "em" or "strong" tag. Because I don’t actually need this information to be emphasized, I might just use a class with a "span" tag to style this text. </p>
        <p>I didn’t have current problems on my “labs” page, but most of my potential problems were the same as the problems in my home page since all pages share the same header and footer.</p>
        <p>Without styling, my images are really big, so I would also need to find a way to make them smaller. Also, the contrast for my mailto: link is low, so I would make that darker.</p>
        <p>When I was using voiceover, I could navigate my site fairly easily (after I learned how to use the voiceover). I thought it was interesting that it could recognize whether things were banners or not.</p>
